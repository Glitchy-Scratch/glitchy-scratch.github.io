# What is Glitchy Scratch?

Glitchy Scratch is a modification of the Scratch website (https://scratch.mit.edu) with glitches. It is situated at https://glitchy-scratch.github.io.

# Why Was It Created?

Several bugs and glitches of Scratch became famous at different times. So, I decided to modify the Scratch Website's homepage and get some of them back and create some new glitches.
